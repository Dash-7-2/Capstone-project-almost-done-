  <h3>First steps</h3>
    
  <pre>
      Here are some things you should check first before deciding 
      that someone is being cyberbullied:
      1. Are they really being cyber-bullied?
      <br>
      2. Do I have to get involved or is he/she taking care of it?
      <br> 
      3. Is the person who is bullying calling out hurtful comments, 
      or are they commenting with positive intentions?
      <br>

      If these conditions are met, then someone is being cyber bullied!
      It is time to stop this madness!
    </pre>
    
   
    
      <h3>How The Justice system Can Help</h3>
   
    <pre>

  <h3>What Parents Can Do</h3>
  <pre>
    If you are a parent, and your child is being Cyber-Bullied, then 
    follow these steps to help them deal with or stop it:

    1. Keep moniters and laptops in a common area, so if anything happens,
    you can see the screen. If computers and devices are used in rooms,
    the child might not feel cofmfortable getting up and letting you know,
    so it is best you keep an eye on them

    2.Becom more familiar with the online environment your child is dealing 
    with. Get to know more social media apps, such as Snapchat, Facebook,
    Google Hangouts, Instagram, Twitter, and more. This way, you can ask use 
    app yourself to moniter, or ask your child to show you the profile pages.

    3.Talk With your kids. Talk to them about rules on the internet, or what 
    to do if this happens again. This way, they will be more confident when 
    dealing with bullies.

    4.DO NOT OVERREACT AND BLAME YOUR CHILDREN. This will only sadden them 
    more and cause them to deflate. This only makes things worse. Be supportive,
    and find out more about how long this has been going on for. Do not shrug
    them off either. This is a very serious problem, and should be delt with 
    quickly and effectively. Guide them and give suggestions, but never, ever, shrug 
    them off.

   <h3>How to help yourself</h3>
  <pre>
    If you are getting cyberbullied, follow the steps below to help you stop 
    the bully:

    1. Never ever be aggresive towards the bully back. Sometimes they are looking
    for a way to get <b>you</b> into trouble. Do not respond with sadness either.
    If you do, the cyberbully might be incouraged to hurt you more. Simply don't 
    respond at all, and try to remove yourself from the situation.
    <br>
    2. Keep the evidence of the bullying. One of teh best things about these new 
    phones and devices is that you are able to capture pretty much anything. Keep
    a screenshot as proof, and show it to authorities or your parents. This way,
    a cyberbully cannot lie their way out of trouble.
    <br>
    3. As technology evolves, more tools are availeable. You can use these tools
    to help stop cyberbullying. Blocking a cyberbullies account will stop them 
    from reaching you, and reporting them will stop them from reching anyone.
    You can also share this online with the police themselves, allowing them to 
    take action.
